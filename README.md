# visible-Waterkarming
deep learning visible watermarking 

This code imports the necessary module from the Pillow library, defines a function to add a watermark to an image,
and then demonstrates how to use this function with sample image paths.

The function first opens the base and watermark images, resizes the watermark if necessary, 
creates a transparent image to overlay the watermark, and finally saves the output image with the watermark added.
